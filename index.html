            <h2>The Science</h2>
            <p>
                Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine content. It is one of the most popular drinks in the world. 
                The main ingredient in coffee is caffeine - a compound that naturally derives from over 60 different 
                plant sources, including coffee beans, tea leaves, cacao seeds and cola nut seeds.
            </p>

            <p>
                Caffeine acts as a stimulant by activating the central nervous system. It can combat 
                tiredness and improve concentration and focus.
            </p>

            <p>
                Coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, Indian subcontinent, and Africa. 
                The two most commonly grown are C. arabica and C. robusta.

            <h2>How to Brew It</h2>
            <p>
                There are so many different ways to brew coffee, both at home and when you order it at a coffee shop. You're likely to hear
                some pretty strong opinions if you were to ask someone about which method they prefer. The options are vast, but here are 
                some of the most popular brewing methods according to <a href="https://gamblebaycoffee.com/coffee-brewing-methods/#the_most_common_coffee_brewing_techniques_in_the_world" target="_blank">
